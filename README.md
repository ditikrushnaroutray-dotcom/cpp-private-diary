# 📔 C++ Private Diary 

A simple, secure terminal-based diary application written in C++. This is my first step into C++ development while preparing for the **OJEE 2026** MCA entrance.

## 🚀 Features
- **Secure Storage:** Uses a `.gitignore` to ensure personal entries stay on my local machine and never leak to GitHub.
- **Fast Execution:** Compiled with `g++` on Linux Mint.
- **Developer Habit:** Built as part of my journey to master the "Basics" before graduation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **OS:** Linux Mint
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## 📈 Goals
- Add automatic timestamping using `<ctime>`.
- Implement simple XOR encryption for entry security.
